Colorimeter
-----------

Design files, software and firmware for IO Rodeos's open source (hardware &
software) scientific colorimeter kit for educators, students and DIY
scientists. 

Colorimeters are analytical devices commonly used in science labs to measure
the concentration of a solution from its light absorbing properties.
Colorimeters are extremely useful and flexible lab instruments for a wide range
of science education labs. Some examples of how the colorimeter can be used for
are listed below.

* Investigate Beers Law - Use food dye or other colored solution to investigate
the relationship between concentration and absorbance;

* Water quality - measure several water parameters such as turbidity, pH, water
hardness, phosphate content and more;

* Population growth - measure the absorbance of a microbial culture over time to
follow population growth;

* Enzyme kinetics - measure the activity of an enzyme over time and different
environmental parameters (temp, pH, inhibitors); Nitrogen cycle - quantify the
amount of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate in a newly established aquarium.
