Colorimeter
-----------

Design files, software and firmware for IO Rodeos's open source (hardware &
software) scientific colorimeter kit for educators, students and DIY
scientists. Colorimeters are analytical devices commonly used in science labs to measure
the concentration of a solution from its light absorbing properties.
Colorimeters are extremely useful and flexible lab instruments for a wide range
of science education labs. 

This packages contains:

* Design files for the colorimeter Electronic Kicad) and Mechanical (py2scad) components.

* Arduino firmware and Python serial library for communicating the colorimeter.  

* A suite of software (w/GUI) for taking measurements with the colorimeter - e.g. 
  measuring transmittance and absorbance, generating standard curves, and  measuring 
  the concentration of solutions.
